**Big Data Hardware Components**
                ***Essential hardware components required for big data architecture, and the need for a distributed system that appears centralized to the user.***
                ***This architecture supports the scalability and complexity required for big data processing, ensuring efficient data handling and computation across distributed systems.***
    └── **Servers**: Utilizes general-purpose computers similar to those in our homes, forming the backbone of big data architecture.
    └── **Central Processing Units (CPUs)**: Each server is equipped with multiple CPUs to handle complex computational tasks efficiently.
    └── **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: A significant amount of RAM in each server allows for fast access to data and efficient processing.
    └── **Hard Drives**: Servers contain hard drives for the stable storage of both raw data collected from the real world and processed results.
    └── **Distributed Accessibility**: The architecture aims to provide distributed access to CPUs, memory, and storage, making their use transparent and giving a false sense of centrality for the user.
        └── This means users experience the system as if there is a single set of CPUs, a central memory unit, and a centralized storage system, despite the physical distribution across multiple servers.
    └── **Data Distribution and Replication**: Data is distributed and replicated across various servers to support the distributed computing model.
    └── **Simplified and Efficient Computing Environment**: The programming environment is designed to distribute computational tasks simply and efficiently, ensuring the system's scalability and performance.
