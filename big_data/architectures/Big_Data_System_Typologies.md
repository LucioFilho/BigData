        └── **Characteristics**: 
            └── Provide scalable storage and are optimized for a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document, wide-column, and graph.
        └── **Use Cases**: 
            └── Web applications, content management systems, and e-commerce platforms.
        └── **Examples**: 
            └── MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and Neo4j.
    └── **Data Processing Frameworks**:
        └── **Characteristics**: 
            └── Offer libraries and tools for complex analytical computations and data manipulation at scale.
        └── **Use Cases**: 
            Machine learning model training, scientific computations, and advanced analytics.
        └── **Examples**: 
            └── Apache Spark for general-purpose data processing and TensorFlow for machine learning.
    └── **Search and Indexing Systems**:
        └── **Characteristics**: 
            └── Optimized for fast data retrieval through indexing mechanisms.
        └── **Use Cases**: 
            └── Internet search engines, product recommendation systems, and log analysis tools.
        └── **Examples**: 
            └── Elasticsearch and Apache Solr.
    └── **Data Management and Integration Platforms**:
        └── **Characteristics**: 
            └── Provide tools for data cleaning, transformation, integration, and governance.
        └── **Use Cases**: 
            └── Data warehousing, ETL processes, and data integration from disparate sources.
        └── **Examples**: 
            └── Apache NiFi for data flow management and Talend for data integration.
    └── **Cloud-based Big Data Services**:
        └── **Characteristics**: 
            └── Offer big data processing and storage capabilities as a service, with scalability and flexibility.
        └── **Use Cases**:
