'''Using NumPy's arange function to generate arrays is a classic example of vectorization, 
where operations are applied to whole arrays at once rather than iterating through elements 
one by one. This method is not only more syntactically concise but also significantly faster 
due to NumPy's underlying C implementations. Here are some examples to illustrate the concept:'''
import numpy as np

## Basic Range Generation ##

# Using a Loop
n = 10
numbers = []
for i in range(n):
    numbers.append(i)
print(numbers)

'''This code will print a list of numbers from 0 to 9. 
While straightforward, it's not the most efficient method, 
especially for large values of n.'''

# Using NumPy's arange
n = 10
numbers = np.arange(n)
print(numbers)

'''This one-liner replaces the entire loop with a single, efficient call to np.arange, 
generating an array of numbers from 0 to n-1.'''

## Example Applications of np.arange ##
'''Let's explore more practical examples where avoiding 
explicit loops with np.arange can be beneficial.'''

# Summing Numbers
# Instead of looping to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers:
total = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    total += i

# You can use np.arange and np.sum:
total = np.sum(np.arange(1, n+1))

# Conditional Selection
'''To create an array of numbers that meet a specific condition without looping, 
such as all even numbers up to n, you might think to use a loop like this:'''
evens = []
for i in range(n):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(i)

# With np.arange, you can do this vectorized:
evens = np.arange(0, n, 2)  # Start at 0, go up to n, step by 2

# Performing Operations on a Range
'''If you want to apply a mathematical operation to a range of numbers, 
like squaring them, instead of:'''
squares = []
for i in range(n):
    squares.append(i**2)

# You can use:
squares = np.arange(n)**2

## Why Avoid Loops? ##
'''The examples above demonstrate the efficiency and elegance 
of vectorized operations with NumPy over explicit Python loops 
for array creation and manipulation:'''

# Performance: 
'''NumPy operations are implemented in C, making them 
far faster than Python loops, especially for large arrays.'''

# Readability: 
'''Vectorized operations can often be expressed in a single line, 
making the code cleaner and easier to understand.'''

# Memory Efficiency: 
'''NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient than Python lists, especially for large datasets.'''

'''Vectorization is a key concept in numerical computing with Python, 
enabling you to leverage the full power of NumPy for fast and efficient data processing.'''
