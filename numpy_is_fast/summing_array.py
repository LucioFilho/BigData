'''Leveraging NumPy's operations, such as numpy.sum(), allows for significant 
performance improvements over manual iteration and summation in Python 
due to their implementation in C. This means operations are not only more concise 
but also optimized for speed and efficiency. '''
import numpy as np

## Summing an Array ##

# Manual Summation with a Loop
'''A traditional approach to summing all elements of a list involves 
iterating over each element and adding it to a total variable:'''

'''While this method works, it's not the most efficient, 
especially as the size of the list grows.'''
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = 0
for number in numbers:
    total += number
print(total)

# Using numpy.sum()
# With NumPy, you can sum the elements of an array more efficiently:
'''This method is faster due to NumPy's optimized C implementation 
and avoids the overhead of Python's loop constructs.'''
numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
total = np.sum(numbers)
print(total)

## Multidimensional Arrays ##
'''NumPy's sum function becomes even more powerful with multidimensional arrays, 
offering flexibility not easily matched by manual loops.'''

# Summing Along an Axis
# Consider a 2D array representing matrix data:
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# To sum the elements along the columns (vertical sum):
column_sum = np.sum(matrix, axis=0)
print("Column sums:", column_sum)

# To sum the elements along the rows (horizontal sum):
row_sum = np.sum(matrix, axis=1)
print("Row sums:", row_sum)

'''These operations would require nested loops and conditional logic 
if done manually, significantly complicating the code.'''

## Conditional Summation ##
'''Another powerful feature of NumPy is the ability 
to perform conditional operations efficiently.'''

# Summing Conditionally
'''To sum only the elements greater than a certain value, 
you would need to combine condition checking and summation in a loop:'''
total = 0
for number in numbers:
    if number > 3:
        total += number

# NumPy allows you to vectorize this operation:
total = np.sum(numbers[numbers > 3])
print(total)

'''This code is not only more succinct but also faster, 
as the condition and summation are both executed in optimized C code.'''

## Performance Comparison ##
'''The performance difference becomes particularly evident with large arrays. 
NumPy operations can be orders of magnitude faster than their manual Python counterparts, 
a difference that grows with the size of the dataset.'''

## Conclusion ##
'''Leveraging NumPy's operations like numpy.sum() showcases the library's strength 
in efficiently performing numerical computations. 
By minimizing Python loop overhead and utilizing optimized C implementations, 
NumPy offers a powerful toolset for data analysis and scientific computing. 
This approach exemplifies the best practices in Python for handling large datasets and complex 
numerical tasks, ensuring code is not only more readable but significantly faster.'''
