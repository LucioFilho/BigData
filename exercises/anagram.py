'''The algorithm you've provided is a Python method to check if two strings are 
anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the 
letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters 
exactly once.'''

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        f = {}

        for c in s:
            if c in f:
                f[c] += 1
            else:
                f[c] = 1

        for c in t:
            if c not in f:
                return False
            elif f[c] == 1:
                del f[c]
            else:
                f[c] -= 1

        return not f

'''In this isAnagram method, s and t are the two strings to compare. 
The method uses a dictionary f to count the occurrences of each character in 
the first string s. Then it iterates over the second string t and decrements 
the count of each character in the dictionary. If a character from t isn't 
found in f or if after decrementing all counts, f isn't empty (meaning there 
are leftover characters that weren't matched), it returns False. If all counts 
are decremented properly and f is empty, it returns True, indicating that s 
and t are anagrams.'''

'''The given method for checking if two strings are anagrams is already quite efficient; 
however, we can make it slightly more so by using Python's Counter from the collections 
module, which is designed specifically for this kind of tallying.'''

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t)

'''The Counter objects created from the strings s and t are dictionaries that map 
each character to the number of times it appears. Comparing these two Counter objects 
directly checks whether both strings have the same characters in the same quantities, 
which is exactly the definition of an anagram.

This method is more efficient in the sense that it utilizes the built-in Counter class, 
which is optimized for this type of counting task. Moreover, the code is simpler and 
easier to read.'''
